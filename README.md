# DigitalAssistant

Digital assistant that speaks and listens to you speak - and gives you answers. Uses both ChatGPT and WolframAlpha as a backup

# Installation
#i used python 3.11, here are the modules, most are for you speaking to the ai, rest are ai speaking to you as well as APIs for question/answers and ofcourse requests
* requests
* openai
* wolframalpha
* pyttsx3 
* SpeechRecognition
* pydub
* pipwin
* pyaudio

- You are absolutely free to remove these modules if you want to type your question to your DA :
SpeechRecognition
pydub
pipwin
pyaudio

- And these if you want your DA to just output text :
pyttsx3 

# Usage
run the mic_thing.py and ask your question in the microphone :)

- Hint: Both APIs are free to get :) OpenAI is an AI, Wolfram is just a really good search engine that answers questions really well - but not nearly as good as Chatgpt, so its just a backup in case chatgpt fails
